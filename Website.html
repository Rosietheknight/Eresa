<h1>Hello fools, you've been trapped in this domain</h1>

<h2> how could you even get out?</h2>

<p> I don't know man, figure it out yourself</p>

<h3> Well man, looks like you're stuck here</h3>

<ol>
    <li> No-clip</li>
    <li> Just die</li>
    <li> Live the rest of your life here</li>
    <li> I don't care, not my issue to solve</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li> Listen man, I said I don't care</li>
    <li> Live here, die, i don't care</li>
    <li> I'm being serious</li>
    <li> Fine, you can stay, just sit over there for now</li>
</ul>
