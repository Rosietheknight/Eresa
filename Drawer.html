        <p><em> This drawer seems safe and worry free. There are many contents in the drawer, ranging from writing utinsels and paper, to what seems to be photos. Compared to the outside world that you've been living in for the past while, just looking in the drawer brings a sense of home back. This must have been what they were holding onto to keep themself going. Personal belongings and notes were thrown throughout the drawer.</em></p>
