              <p> <mark> <small> <sub> Hey freak- You can help me right? Hey, take this key from my pocket- It holds access to all that I hold valuable-</sub></small></mark></p>

              <h2> <del> They're gone. <stong> You</stong> let them die. Here, I'll be so polite and drop the key into your hand. Of course, I can't let a killer access the ictims body, who knows what twisted stuff you'll do. Maybe skin it, perhaps eat it, I don't know, not my issue.</del></h2>

              <p> <em> You're stuck thinking about what you've done. You now have to have the death of someone on your conscious, as you did indeed decide to kill them, <strong> monster.</strong> you have their key, where does it go? Probably in that desk drawer. You can open it if you want, you don't really have to. It's just all they hold dear, no biggie. If you don't want to, just keep going, don't bother with it.</em></p>
